## ‚öôÔ∏è System Operation

Dive deeper into how each node functions within the system:

### Sensor Node (Node 1)

1.  Continuously reads data from all connected sensors (DHT11, HC-SR04, IR, MPU6050).
2.  Publishes the collected sensor data to their respective MQTT topics **every 2 seconds**.
3.  The MPU6050 provides angular velocity data in **radians per second**.

### Actuator Node (Node 2)

1.  Subscribes to all relevant sensor data topics from the MQTT broker.
2.  Controls actuators based on predefined conditions derived from sensor readings:
    * **Relay:** Activates when temperature exceeds **30¬∞C**.
    * **Buzzer:** Sounds an alert when humidity surpasses **70%**.
    * **LED:** Illuminates when an object is detected within **20cm**.
    * **Servo Motor:** Adjusts its position based on the state of the IR sensor (e.g., opens/closes a gate).
    * **DC Motor:** Its speed is dynamically adjusted in response to temperature fluctuations (e.g., fan speed control).

### Monitor Node (Node 3)

1.  Subscribes to all sensor data topics from the MQTT broker.
2.  Displays the live sensor data on the I2C LCD.
3.  Alternates the displayed information **every 2 seconds**:
    * **First screen:** Shows Temperature, Humidity, Distance, and IR sensor state.
    * **Second screen:** Displays MPU6050 gyroscope data (X, Y, Z angular velocities).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To get this project up and running, follow these simple steps:

3.  **Upload Firmware:** Upload the respective code (`sensor_node.ino`, `actuator_node.ino`, `monitor_node.ino` - *filenames are examples, adjust as per your actual project files*) to each of your ESP32 boards.

4.  **Power On:** Once the code is uploaded, power on all three ESP32 nodes.

5.  **Monitor (Optional):** For initial debugging and verification, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE for each node to observe their output and connection status.

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Setup

To ensure everything is working as expected:

1.  **Verify MQTT Connection:** Confirm that all nodes successfully connect to your MQTT broker. Check the Serial Monitor output for connection messages.
2.  **Check Sensor Readings:** Observe the Serial Monitor output from the Sensor Node to ensure accurate sensor readings are being published.
3.  **Verify Actuator Responses:** Interact with the sensors (e.g., change temperature, bring an object close to the IR sensor) and confirm that the actuators on the Actuator Node respond as programmed.
4.  **Confirm LCD Display Updates:** Watch the I2C LCD on the Monitor Node to ensure it's displaying live sensor values and periodically updating with gyroscope data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter any issues, consider these common problems and solutions:

1.  **Wi-Fi Connectivity:**
    * Double-check your **SSID and password** in the code.
    * Ensure your ESP32 boards are within range of your Wi-Fi router.
    * Restart your Wi-Fi router.
2.  **MQTT Broker Connection:**
    * Verify that your MQTT broker is running and accessible.
    * Confirm the MQTT broker's **IP address or hostname** in your code is correct.
    * Check for firewall issues that might block MQTT ports.
3.  **Incorrect Pin Connections:**
    * Carefully review the **Hardware Connections** section and verify that all sensors and actuators are wired to the correct GPIO pins on each ESP32.
4.  **Insufficient Power Supply:**
    * Ensure that all components, especially the actuators and sensors, are receiving adequate power (voltage and current). Some components might require external power sources.
